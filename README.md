## Linear search using loop and if else
Linear search is a very basic and simple search algorithm. In Linear search, we search by traversing throughout the array  each and an element or value in a given array by traversing the array from the starting, till the desired element or value is found.The time complexity of Linear search algorithm is O(n) .In best case it can be of O(1) and in worst case it can be of O(n)<br/>
